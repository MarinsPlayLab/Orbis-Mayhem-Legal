**Effective date:** 18 November 2025  

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the mobile video game **Orbis Mayhem** and any related services (collectively, the “Game”) provided by **Marins PlayLab Studio** (“we”, “us”, “our”).

Marins PlayLab Studio is a small, hobbyist indie game development studio based in the European Union. By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Game, you agree to be bound by these Terms, by our **Orbis Mayhem – Privacy Policy**, and by any applicable app store or platform rules (such as Google Play and Apple Media Services terms). If you do not agree, do not install or use the Game.

## 2. Relationship With the Privacy Policy

Your use of the Game is also governed by our **Orbis Mayhem – Privacy Policy**, which explains how we process personal data in connection with the Game (including guest and registered accounts, leaderboards, and chat).

By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.

---

## 3. Eligibility and Age Requirements

- The Game is not targeted at children and is primarily intended for users aged **18 and above**.
- The minimum age to play the Game is **13 years old**.
- If you are **under 18**, you may only proceed if you confirm that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed these Terms and the Privacy Policy with you and, where required by law, has provided any necessary consent.
- Players **under 13** must **not** use the Game. The first-launch age selector has a minimum setting of 13, and the Game will deny access if an age below 13 is selected or otherwise detected.

By using the Game, you represent and warrant that:

- The age you provide through the in-game age confirmation (shown on first launch, account creation, or when changing from guest to registered account) is truthful and accurate;
- If you are under 18, you have had these Terms and the Privacy Policy reviewed with you by a parent or legal guardian and you have any consent required by applicable law;
- You will promptly stop using the Game if you fall below the permitted age or if a guardian revokes consent.

Guardians can contact us at **contact@marinsplaylab.studio** with the player’s account ID (available in the in-game account settings) to review, provide, or revoke consent, request deletion of an underage account, or raise any related concerns. If we learn that an account belongs to a player under 13, or that a 13–17-year-old does not have appropriate consent, we may suspend or delete the account to comply with the law and our policies.

We may generate anonymised age analytics to understand the age distribution of our players and improve compliance measures, as further described in the Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Game complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and app store rules in your jurisdiction.

## 4. Account Types and Access

The Game may allow different ways to access and play.

### 4.1 Guest Accounts (Anonymous Play)

You may be able to play as a “guest” without creating a full registered account.

- A **random guest identifier** may be stored locally on your device to keep track of your progress on that device only.  
- Guest profiles are designed to be anonymous from our perspective: we do not intentionally link guest identifiers to real-world identity.  
- Guest progress is tied to your device and local data; if you delete the app, reset your device, change device, or clear app data, your guest progress will likely be **permanently lost**.

By using guest mode, you acknowledge and agree that:

- You are **fully responsible** for any loss of data or progress associated with guest play.  
- We have **no obligation** and generally **no technical ability** to restore guest progress.  
- Guest mode is provided “as is” and is inherently less reliable for long-term progress than a registered account.

We strongly encourage players who care about long-term progression or cross-device continuity to create a registered account where available.

### 4.2 Registered Accounts

The Game may allow or require you to create a persistent account, for example via:

- A game backend or authentication service (e.g., Unity services or equivalent); and/or  
- Third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Apple, or other supported services).

When you create or use a registered account:

- You must provide accurate and up-to-date information where required (for example, display name or linked third-party account).  
- You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure and for all activities that occur under your account.  
- You must not share your account or credentials with others or allow others to use your account in violation of these Terms or applicable laws.

We may, at our discretion and where technically possible, assist with account-related issues, but we do not guarantee recovery of accounts or progress in all situations.

---

## 5. License Grant

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and with applicable app store rules, we grant you a **personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and non-sublicensable license** to:

- Download, install, and use one copy of the Game on a compatible device that you own or control; and  
- Use the Game solely for your own non-commercial, personal entertainment.

You obtain only a license to use the Game. You do not acquire ownership or any other rights in the Game or its content beyond what is expressly granted in these Terms.

---

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

You agree **not** to do any of the following, except to the extent that applicable law expressly permits it:

1. **Copying and distribution**  
   - Copy, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, or otherwise exploit the Game or any part thereof for commercial purposes.

2. **Modification and reverse engineering**  
   - Modify, adapt, translate, merge, or create derivative works based on the Game or any content within it.  
   - Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Game, any related software, or any proprietary protocol, except where such activities are expressly allowed by mandatory law.

3. **Security and anti-cheat circumvention**  
   - Bypass, remove, hack, change, damage, or otherwise interfere with any security, anti-cheat, digital rights management, or technical protection measures used in or in connection with the Game.

4. **Cheating and unfair advantage**  
   - Use cheats, bots, automation tools, hacks, mods, trainers, or any unauthorised third-party software that modifies or interferes with the Game, gameplay, or network communication.

5. **Unauthorised access**  
   - Attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Game, its servers, or any related systems, including by probing, scanning, or testing for vulnerabilities.

6. **Illegal or harmful behaviour**  
   - Use the Game for any illegal, fraudulent, or harmful purpose.  
   - Engage in behaviour that violates the rights of others, including harassment, defamation, hate speech, threats, or stalking.

7. **Improper account use**  
   - Sell, rent, lease, license, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer accounts, the Game, or any rights in it, except as allowed by the relevant app store rules (for example, family sharing where permitted).

Any breach of this section may lead to suspension or termination of your access to the Game.

## 7. Virtual Items, In-Game Purchases, and Store Rules

### 7.1 In-Game Purchases

The Game may allow you to purchase virtual items, virtual currencies, or other digital content using real money or in-game currency.

All real-money purchases are processed by the relevant platform provider, **not** by us directly:

- **Google Play (Android)**  
  - Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy  
  - Google Terms of Service: https://policies.google.com/terms  
  - Google Play Terms of Service: https://play.google.com/intl/en-US/about/play-terms/index.html  

- **Apple App Store / Apple Media Services (iOS / iPadOS)**  
  - Apple Customer Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/  
  - Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/  

You must comply with the relevant store rules. We do not control the billing processes, refund procedures, or account management operated by these stores.

### 7.2 Nature of Virtual Items

- Virtual items and virtual currencies have **no real-world monetary value** and are not redeemable for money or any monetary equivalent from us or any other party.
- You obtain only a limited license to use virtual items within the Game; you do not gain any property rights in them.
- We may, at our discretion and subject to applicable law, modify, balance, remove, or discontinue virtual items, virtual currencies, or features at any time, with or without notice.

Unless required by applicable consumer law or app store policies, **all sales of virtual items are final and non-refundable**.

### 7.3 Refunds, Withdrawal Rights, and Store Responsibilities

- Refunds for purchases made through Google Play, the Apple App Store, or any other authorized platform are handled exclusively by those stores under their own policies. We do not process refunds directly.
- Where EU or local consumer law grants a statutory withdrawal right for digital content, you acknowledge that delivery of the virtual item begins immediately after purchase. By confirming the purchase in the store interface, you request that delivery start immediately and acknowledge that the withdrawal right is waived once delivery begins, except where the store expressly provides otherwise.
- Any refund that a store grants or denies is governed by that store’s decision. We will follow and implement the store’s outcome (for example, by revoking items if a refund occurs).

---

## 8. Third-Party Services and Legal Documents

The Game uses or interacts with third-party services. These services have their own terms and policies that govern your relationship with them. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those documents.

### 8.1 Unity Services (Ads, Analytics, Backend, Accounts)

We may use Unity services, including but not limited to **Unity Ads**, **Unity Analytics**, and backend/account services, which are governed by Unity’s legal documents, including:

- Unity Privacy Policy: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy  
- Unity Game Player and App User Privacy Policy: https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy  

Unity may collect and process data for delivering ads, providing backend functionality (such as login, cloud save, or matchmaking), combating fraud and abuse, and improving its services.

### 8.2 GitHub and Open-Source Licenses

Where we publish Game-related materials on GitHub, your use of GitHub and any content hosted there is governed by:

- GitHub Terms of Service: https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service  

Each repository may also contain a `LICENSE` file or other notice specifying the license for that code or content. That license governs what you may or may not do with the material, in addition to GitHub’s own terms.

### 8.3 Other Third Parties and Updates to the List

As the Game evolves, we may integrate additional third-party services (for example, crash reporting, additional analytics or ad networks, matchmaking backends, or anti-cheat systems). The exact list may change over time.

- We commit to updating the list of third parties in these Terms and in the Privacy Policy as soon as reasonably practical when we add or remove integrations. Because releases sometimes ship quickly, there may be a short delay between enabling a new third-party SDK and updating the documentation. In that case, the SDK’s own consent prompts and disclosures apply until the documentation is updated.
- At the time of this version, the principal third parties involved in the Game are **Google Play**, **Apple App Store / Apple Media Services**, **Unity services (including Ads, Analytics, and backend)**, and **GitHub** for repositories.
- You should always review the legal documents and consent dialogs presented by your device, operating system, app store, and any SDKs or services within the Game.

We are not responsible for the availability or performance of third-party services or for any damage arising from your separate relationship with those providers, except to the minimum extent required by mandatory law.

## 9. User-Generated Content, Leaderboards, and Global Chat

### 9.1 User-Generated Content

The Game may allow you to create or submit content, such as:

- Display names/usernames, avatars, and player profiles;  
- Chat messages and other communications in lobbies or global chat;  
- Other text, images, or in-game content where features allow.

You remain fully responsible for any content you submit or display through the Game. You agree that you will not submit content that:

- Is illegal, infringing, or violates any third-party rights (including copyright, trademark, privacy, or personality rights);  
- Contains hate speech, threats, harassment, discrimination, or explicit sexual content;  
- Contains malware, spam, or other harmful code.

By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and distribute such content in connection with operating and improving the Game (for example, showing your messages to other players, logging content for moderation, or using anonymised examples to improve systems). See the Privacy Policy (Section 4.7) for details on how moderation data is stored and retained.

### 9.2 Leaderboards and Rankings

If the Game features leaderboards and rankings:

- Your username, performance metrics (such as scores, level, or rank), and possibly approximate region may be displayed to other players;  
- Leaderboard information may be wiped, reset, or adjusted as part of normal gameplay, balancing, or seasonal changes.

### 9.3 Global Chat and Community Behaviour

If the Game includes global chat or similar communication features:

- You must behave respectfully towards other players;  
- You must not harass, threaten, insult, or otherwise abuse others;  
- You must not spam messages or advertise illegal or harmful services.

We may use automated tools, human moderation, or both to monitor, record, and review communications where necessary for security, moderation, or evidence in case of disputes, as described in the Privacy Policy.

We may take moderation actions, including but not limited to:

- Deleting or editing messages or content;  
- Muting or restricting chat functionality;  
- Issuing warnings or temporary timeouts;  
- Suspending or permanently banning accounts or devices from the Game.

These actions are at our discretion to protect the Game, its community, and our rights, subject to applicable law.

---

## 10. Fan Content and Community Sharing

We support respectful fan-made creations such as gameplay videos, screenshots, live streams, guides, and community discussions.

- You may capture, record, stream, or share gameplay footage and screenshots for non-commercial purposes, provided you include reasonable credit to **Orbis Mayhem** and **Marins PlayLab Studio** (for example, mentioning the Game name and linking to an official page or store listing where possible).
- You must not claim or imply that your fan content is an official product, partnership, or endorsement from us unless we provide written permission.
- Critique and commentary are welcome, but content that incites violence against the developers, promotes hate, or otherwise crosses into severe disrespect or harassment is not permitted and may lead to takedowns or in-game enforcement.
- Selling merchandise or monetising the Game’s assets beyond the incidental monetisation available on platforms such as YouTube or Twitch (e.g., ad revenue sharing from gameplay videos) requires our prior written consent.

All fan content remains subject to these Terms, our community guidelines, and applicable law. We may request removal of content that violates these conditions.

## 11. Ownership of Code and Assets

Unless expressly stated otherwise (for example, in specific in-game credits, on the store page, or in a README/`LICENSE` file on GitHub):

- All original code, game logic, gameplay systems, art, design, story elements, names, logos, music, sound effects, and other creative elements of Orbis Mayhem are created and owned by the developers of Orbis Mayhem, acting under the name **Marins PlayLab Studio**;  
- Some assets used in the Game (for example, visual, audio, or code components) may come from third-party sources such as asset store marketplaces (e.g., Unity Asset Store) or other licensed providers. Those assets remain the property of their respective owners and are used under appropriate licenses or purchase agreements.

Except for the limited license granted to you under Section 5, no rights are granted to you in or to any intellectual property, whether owned by Marins PlayLab Studio or third parties.

---

## 12. Health, Safety, and Device Use

Before or when you first start playing the Game, we may display one or more warning screens. By continuing to use the Game, you confirm that you have read and understood these warnings and agree to follow them.

You agree in particular that:

- If you have, or suspect you have, any condition that could be affected by visual stimuli (including photosensitivity), you will **not** play the Game unless cleared by a medical professional;  
- If you feel unwell, disoriented, dizzy, experience vision problems, or any other adverse symptoms while playing, you will **stop playing immediately**;  
- You will **not** use the Game while driving, operating machinery, or in any situation where distraction could cause injury to yourself or others;  
- You will use the Game only on devices that are in safe working condition and are not physically damaged, overheating, or otherwise unsafe.

We did not design or manufacture your device, operating system, or network connection. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for:

- Any hardware failures, defects, or damages relating to your device;  
- Any issues caused by your operating system, device modifications (including rooting/jailbreaking), or third-party software;  
- Any consequences of ignoring health and safety warnings.

You use the Game at your own risk and are responsible for your own health, safety, and hardware.

---

## 13. Security, Encryption, and Network Architecture

The Game is designed to use reasonable technical measures to protect your data and provide secure gameplay, as described in the Privacy Policy.

In particular:

- We aim to use encrypted connections (such as TLS/HTTPS or equivalent) for user- and account-related data wherever supported by the platform and our infrastructure;  
- The Game is designed to use **authoritative servers** for core gameplay networking, meaning that gameplay traffic is intended to flow between your device and our servers or trusted infrastructure, not directly between players.

However, no system is completely secure or error-free. You acknowledge that:

- Some level of downtime, latency, bugs, or technical issues is inevitable;  
- We cannot guarantee that the Game will be free from all vulnerabilities or that it will always be available or uninterrupted.

---

## 14. Disclaimer of Warranties

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- The Game is provided on an **“as is” and “as available”** basis, without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory;  
- We do not guarantee that the Game will be error-free, secure, or available at all times, or that defects will be corrected;  
- We do not guarantee that the Game will be compatible with all devices, operating systems, or hardware configurations.

These disclaimers apply to the fullest extent permitted by law and do not remove any mandatory consumer rights that apply to you.

---

## 15. Limitation of Liability and Responsibility for Use

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

1. **Exclusion of certain damages**  
   We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill, or loss of opportunity, arising out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the Game.

2. **Cap on liability**  
   Our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Game or these Terms is limited to the amount you have paid to us (if any) for in-game purchases in the six (6) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

3. **Your responsibility**  
   You are fully responsible for:
   - How you use the Game and any consequences of your actions in or through the Game;  
   - Ensuring that your use of the Game complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction;  
   - Safeguarding your account credentials and devices;  
   - Accepting the risk of data and progress loss when using guest mode;  
   - Following all health, safety, and device-use warnings we provide.

If and to the extent that applicable law does not allow some of the limitations above, those limitations will apply only to the extent permitted by that law.

---

## 16. Termination and Suspension

We may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Game (in whole or in part) if:

- You materially breach these Terms or any applicable app store rules;  
- Your behaviour (including cheating, hacking, harassment, or other abuse) poses a security, technical, or legal risk to us, the Game, or other players;  
- We decide to discontinue the Game or any part of it for business, legal, or technical reasons.

Where reasonable and required by law, we will attempt to provide prior notice. Upon termination:

- Your license to use the Game will automatically end;  
- We may delete or restrict access to your account and related data, subject to legal retention obligations and the Privacy Policy;  
- You will not be entitled to any compensation for unused virtual items or access, except as required by mandatory consumer law or app store policies.

You may stop using the Game at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Uninstalling does not automatically entitle you to any refund.

---

## 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Croatia**, together with applicable **European Union law**, without prejudice to any mandatory consumer protection provisions of the law of your country of residence.

If you are a consumer resident in the EU/EEA, you may also have the right to bring legal proceedings in your home country, in accordance with applicable law.

---

## 18. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be incorrect, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

---

## 19. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect:

- Changes in the Game or our services (including accounts, leaderboards, chat, or other features);  
- Changes in app store rules or third-party integrations;  
- Changes in legal or regulatory requirements.

When we make changes, we will update the **Effective date** at the top of this document. Where required or appropriate, we will also provide in-game or app-store notices. Your continued use of the Game after the revised Terms become effective constitutes your acceptance of them, to the extent permitted by law. If you do not agree with the updated Terms, you must stop using the Game and uninstall it.
