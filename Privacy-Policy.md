# Orbis Mayhem – Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 18 November 2025  

This Privacy Policy explains how **Marins PlayLab Studio** (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes personal data in connection with the mobile video game **Orbis Mayhem** (the “Game”), made available in the European Union and other regions via authorized app stores.

Marins PlayLab Studio is a small, hobbyist indie game development studio. Our goal is to deliver a secure and engaging experience while collecting and using as little personal data as reasonably possible.

---

## 1. Data Controller

The data controller for personal data processed in connection with the Game is:

**Marins PlayLab Studio**  
Independent hobbyist indie game development studio based in the European Union  

Contact for data protection and privacy matters:  
**Email:** OrbisMayhem@protonmail.com  

---

## 2. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to:

- Use of the Game on mobile devices (Android, iOS, or other supported platforms).  
- Related online services we provide, such as in-game notices, accounts, leaderboards, global chat, and moderation tools.  
- Official code or materials related to the Game that we publish on GitHub, to the extent that we process personal data in that context.

This Policy does **not** govern how third-party services process your data. Those services have their own privacy policies and terms, which you must review separately.

---

## 3. Our Data Principles

From our side, we apply these principles:

1. **Data minimisation**  
   We aim to collect only data that is required to operate, secure, and improve the Game, and only data that you or your device provide in connection with using the Game.

2. **Limited processing and purpose limitation**  
   We use personal data only for clear purposes such as gameplay, user experience improvements, bug fixing, security, anti-cheat, and player safety/moderation.

3. **Deletion and anonymisation**  
   We aim to delete or irreversibly anonymise personal data when it is no longer needed for the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, tax, accounting, anti-fraud, or regulatory obligations).

4. **No data harvesting by us**  
   We do not run mass data-harvesting operations, data brokering, or selling of personal data. Our focus is making Orbis Mayhem fun and safe to play, not building a data-mining business.

5. **Third-party independence with timely disclosures**
   We cannot control what large third-party providers do with data they collect as independent controllers (e.g., Google, Apple, Unity, GitHub). They operate under their own legal frameworks. To understand their practices, you must review their policies and terms. We commit to updating this Privacy Policy as soon as reasonably practical whenever we integrate or remove a third-party provider, but there may be a short delay between a release and the documentation update.

## 4. Data We May Process

Depending on how you use the Game and related services, we may process the following categories of data.

### 4.1 Account and Profile Data (Guest Accounts and Registered Accounts)

The Game may allow you to play in different ways:

#### 4.1.1 Guest Accounts (Anonymous Play)

You may be able to play as a “guest” without creating a full account. In that case:

- We may generate a **random guest identifier** that is stored locally on your device to keep track of your progress on that device only.  
- We do **not** intentionally collect directly identifying information (such as your name or email) for guest play.  
- From our side, data associated with a guest profile is extremely limited and is generally not linked to your real identity.

However:

- If you delete the app, reset your device, switch devices, or clear app data, your **guest progress may be permanently lost**.  
- We generally **cannot restore guest progress**, because it is not linked to a persistent, verified account or contact detail.  
- By playing as a guest, you accept that you are fully responsible for any loss of progress or data in guest mode.  

We strongly encourage players who care about long-term progress to register a persistent game account (see below).

#### 4.1.2 Registered Accounts (e.g., via Unity Services or Other Providers)

The Game may allow or require you to create a persistent account, for example using:

- A dedicated game account system (e.g., Unity Authentication or similar services).  
- Third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Apple, or other supported services) where you link your Game profile to an external account.

In that case, we may process:

- A unique account identifier.  
- Display name/username or other profile information you choose to provide (e.g., avatar, region).  
- Linked third-party account identifiers as provided by the login provider (e.g., a Google or Apple account ID, not your password).  
- Basic profile metadata necessary to operate cross-device progression, leaderboards, and moderation (e.g., account creation time, status flags such as bans, mutes, or warnings).

Third-party identity providers process your data under their own terms and policies. When you use them to sign up or sign in, you must also agree to their legal documents.

### 4.2 Gameplay and Usage Data

We may process:

- In-game actions and interactions.  
- Session length and frequency of play.  
- Game modes, progression, achievements, and performance metrics.  
- Non-directly identifying player identifiers (such as a player ID, randomly generated identifier, or store-provided identifier).  
- Interactions with in-game features designed to improve user experience (e.g., tutorials, difficulty, feature usage).

We primarily use this to operate the Game, balance content, improve user experience, and fix bugs.

### 4.3 Device and Technical Data

Collected mainly via app stores and/or third-party SDKs, such as:

- Device model and hardware characteristics.  
- Operating system and version.  
- Language, region, and time zone settings.  
- IP address and general (coarse) location derived from it.  
- Technical logs related to crashes, errors, performance, and network issues.

We use this to ensure compatibility, investigate crashes, improve performance, and protect the Game from abuse and attacks.

### 4.4 Purchase and Store Data

When you make in-app purchases:

- Real-money transactions are processed by **Google Play Store** or **Apple App Store**; we do **not** receive your full payment card details.  
- We may receive purchase-related data from the store, such as:
  - Purchase tokens or receipts  
  - Transaction IDs  
  - Product IDs, price and currency  
  - Purchase status (successful, refunded, chargeback, etc.)

We use this data to validate purchases, grant in-game items, handle refunds in line with store rules (see the Terms of Service §7 for refund procedures), and combat fraud.

### 4.5 Support and Voluntary Communications

If you contact us through any support channel we provide:

- We may process your message content and any information you voluntarily provide (such as device details, screenshots, or logs).  
- We use this data to respond to your request, investigate bugs, improve the Game, and maintain security or fairness where relevant.

### 4.6 GitHub-Related Data

When you interact with our GitHub repositories (for example, reporting issues or submitting pull requests):

- GitHub primarily processes your personal data under its own policies.  
- We may see your public username, profile image, comments, and contributions you make that relate to our repositories.  
- We use this information only to manage our repositories, review contributions, discuss bugs or features, and maintain project history.

### 4.7 Social and Community Features (Leaderboards and Global Chat)

If the Game offers social or community features such as global or regional leaderboards, usernames, global chat, or similar:

We may process:

- Player identifiers and display names (usernames, nicknames, or similar).  
- Leaderboard-related information such as scores, rankings, level, and approximate region (if configured).  
- Chat messages or other user-generated content sent through in-game chat, lobbies, or other communication features.  
- Reports submitted by players about other players (for example, for harassment, cheating, or abuse).  
- Internal moderation data, such as warnings, mutes, timeouts, bans, or appeals, and reasons for those decisions.

We use this data to:

- Provide leaderboards, rankings, and social features.  
- Protect players from harassment, threats, hateful content, spam, or other abuse.  
- Detect and act on cheating, hacking, or other conduct that harms the gameplay experience.  
- Maintain a respectful, safe environment in line with our rules and Terms of Use.

We may review or store copies of chat logs and moderation actions for a limited time when necessary for security, moderation, or evidence in case of disputes. Additional details on how we moderate user-generated content are provided in the Terms of Service (Section 9) and the fan-content section (Section 10).

### 4.8 Age Confirmation and Guardian Contact Data

When you first open the Game or create an account, we ask you to confirm your age using an in-game selector. The minimum selectable age is 13. We store the confirmed age range (for example, “under 13”, “13–17”, “18+”) or a timestamped declaration so that we can:

- Ensure we do not knowingly allow players under 13 to access the Game;
- Confirm that players under 18 have had these terms reviewed with a parent/guardian and collect any consent required by law;
- Demonstrate compliance with applicable laws if questions arise;
- Produce anonymised age analytics to understand the age distribution of our players.

If a parent or guardian contacts us at **OrbisMayhem@protonmail.com** with the player’s account ID (visible in the in-game settings), we may collect the guardian’s name and contact details solely to verify consent decisions, respond to requests (including deletion of an underage account), and keep an audit record of the correspondence.

Providing false age information or failing to secure guardian review or consent when required (for example, between ages 13 and 17) may lead to suspension or deletion of the account in line with the Terms of Service.

---

## 5. Purposes and Legal Bases (GDPR / EU Law)

Under EU data protection law, we must have a valid legal basis for each processing activity. Depending on the context, we rely on:

1. **Performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR)**  
   - To operate the Game and its core functionality.  
   - To process your in-game actions and game state.  
   - To provide in-game purchases and virtual items you have bought.  
   - To operate core social features directly required by the Game (e.g., matchmaking, basic leaderboards).  
   - To provide persistent accounts and cross-device progression where account creation is part of the Game’s core service.

2. **Legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR)**  
   For example:
   - Maintaining and improving the stability, security, and performance of the Game.
   - Detecting and preventing cheating, hacking, fraud, or other misuse.
   - Running non-intrusive analytics to balance gameplay, fix bugs, and improve user experience.
   - Generating anonymised age analytics to understand the overall age distribution of players and improve compliance measures without storing directly identifying age data.
   - Operating and moderating social features (leaderboards, global chat) to keep the environment fair and respectful.
   - Defending our rights and responding to legal claims.

   We balance these interests against your rights and freedoms and apply safeguards such as data minimisation and retention limits.

3. **Legal obligations (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR)**  
   - Compliance with EU and national legal obligations, including accounting, tax, and regulatory requirements.  
   - Obligations to law-enforcement or regulatory authorities where applicable.

4. **Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR)**  
   - Certain analytics, personalised ads, or tracking operations that require consent under GDPR/ePrivacy rules and are implemented via third-party SDKs (for example, Unity Ads or OS-level tracking consent).  
   - Where consent is required, it will be requested via in-game dialogs, SDK prompts, or device/app store mechanisms.

Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time using the mechanisms provided by the SDKs, app store settings, operating system settings, or in-game options (where available). Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services and Their Legal Documents

The Game relies on several independent third-party providers. These entities process personal data as separate controllers under their own privacy policies and terms. You must review their legal documents to understand how they handle your data.

### 6.1 Google – Google Play Store and Related Services (Android)

If you use Orbis Mayhem on Android, Google may process your data under (including but not limited to):

- **Google Privacy Policy**  
  https://policies.google.com/privacy  

- **Google Terms of Service**  
  https://policies.google.com/terms  

- **Google Play Terms of Service**  
  https://play.google.com/intl/en-US/about/play-terms/index.html  

Additional relevant Google documentation regarding Google Play and Google Play Services may apply as published by Google.

### 6.2 Apple – App Store and Apple Media Services (iOS / iPadOS)

If you use Orbis Mayhem on Apple devices, Apple may process your data under:

- **Apple Customer Privacy Policy**  
  https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/  

- **Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions** (including App Store terms)  
  https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/  

### 6.3 Unity – Unity Ads, Unity Analytics, and Account/Backend Services

The Game may integrate **Unity Ads**, **Unity Analytics**, and other Unity services (for example, authentication, game backend, or matchmaking). These are provided by Unity Technologies and are governed by, among others:

- **Unity Privacy Policy**  
  https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy  

- **Unity Game Player and App User Privacy Policy**  
  https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy  

Unity may collect device identifiers, IP address, approximate location, usage data, and ad interaction data for purposes such as:

- Delivering and measuring ads.  
- Combating fraud and abuse.  
- Providing backend services (e.g., accounts, cloud save, matchmaking).  
- Improving Unity’s own services.

We configure Unity’s SDKs and services with the intention of using only what is necessary for operating and monetising the Game, but Unity ultimately controls its own back-end processing as an independent provider.

### 6.4 GitHub – Repositories and Code

Where we publish Orbis Mayhem-related code or content on GitHub, GitHub processes personal data under its own terms, including:

- **GitHub Terms of Service**  
  https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service  

Your interactions with GitHub (for example, account management, browsing, and contributions) are governed by GitHub’s own policies and any repository-specific licenses described in LICENSE files or documentation.

### 6.5 Other Third Parties and Updates

As the Game evolves, we may integrate additional third-party tools or services (for example, platform-level crash reporting, additional analytics or ad networks, matchmaking backends, or anti-cheat systems). The list of third parties may change over time.

- We commit to updating this section and the corresponding section in the Terms of Service as soon as reasonably practical whenever we add or remove a third party. Release schedules may occasionally result in a short lag between deploying a new SDK and documenting it; until the documentation is updated, you should rely on the SDK’s own consent dialogs and notices.
- At the time of this version, the primary third parties are **Google Play**, **Apple App Store / Apple Media Services**, **Unity services (including Ads, Analytics, Authentication, and backend)**, and **GitHub** for repositories.
- You should always review the privacy policies and terms presented by your device manufacturer, operating system provider, app store, and any SDK or service that appears in or around the Game.

We are not responsible for the internal data practices of these independent third parties. Our role is to configure and use third-party tools in a way that aligns with data minimisation and lawful use from our side.

---

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, in particular:

- To provide and maintain the Game and its features (including accounts, leaderboards, and chat).  
- To comply with legal and regulatory obligations.  
- To resolve disputes, enforce our rights, and maintain security and anti-fraud measures.

Once data is no longer needed, we **delete or irreversibly anonymise** it, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, statutory retention for tax or accounting records, or legal hold in case of disputes).

Guest account data stored solely on your device may be lost when you delete the app, reset your device, or clear app data; in that scenario, we generally cannot restore it.

---

## 8. International Data Transfers

Our third-party providers (e.g., Google, Apple, Unity, GitHub) may process personal data on servers located outside the EU/EEA, including in the United States or other countries.

These providers may rely on mechanisms such as:

- Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.  
- Adequacy decisions.  
- Other legally recognised safeguards.

Details about international transfers are described in the respective privacy policies of each provider.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy and Age Limits

The Game is **not targeted at children** and is primarily intended for users aged **18 and above**.

- The minimum age to access the Game is **13**. If you are **under 18**, you may proceed only if you confirm that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, and any app store disclosures with you and, where required by law, has provided the necessary consent.
- Players **under 13** are **not permitted** to access the Game. The in-game age selector has a minimum setting of 13 and will deny access if a lower age is provided. We may also review reports or signals that indicate an account belongs to someone under 13.
- If you are between **13 and 17**, your guardian may contact us at **OrbisMayhem@protonmail.com** with your account ID to provide or revoke consent, request data deletion, or raise concerns. If we do not receive the required consent, we may suspend or delete the account.
- If we learn that we unintentionally collected data from a child below the permitted age or that a 13–17-year-old lacks guardian review or consent where required, we will delete the account or take other appropriate steps to comply with the law.

---

## 10. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR / EU)

Subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- **Right of access:** To obtain confirmation whether we process your data and to receive a copy.  
- **Right to rectification:** To correct inaccurate or incomplete data.  
- **Right to erasure:** To request deletion of your data in certain circumstances (for example, when it is no longer needed, you withdraw consent, or the processing is unlawful).  
- **Right to restriction of processing:** To limit how we process your data in specific cases.  
- **Right to data portability:** To receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, where applicable.  
- **Right to object:**  
  - To processing based on legitimate interests, on grounds relating to your particular situation.  
  - To processing for direct marketing, at any time.  
- **Right to withdraw consent:** Where processing is based on consent, you can withdraw it at any time (this does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal).  
- **Right to lodge a complaint:** To lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated.

For data controlled by us, use the contact details in Section 1 to exercise your rights. For data controlled by third parties (Google, Apple, Unity, GitHub, etc.), you must exercise your rights directly with those providers using the channels described in their policies.

---

## 11. Security, Encryption, and Network Architecture

We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access.

In particular:

- We aim to use encrypted connections (for example, TLS/HTTPS or equivalent) for transmitting **user-related and account-related data** over networks whenever supported by the platform and our infrastructure.  
- The Game is designed to use **authoritative servers** for core gameplay networking. This means gameplay traffic is intended to flow between your device and our servers or trusted infrastructure, not directly between players, so your IP address should not be directly exposed to other players.  
- Sensitive data such as account credentials, tokens, or purchase-related identifiers are handled through platform providers (e.g., Google, Apple) or Unity/other backend services which themselves implement industry-standard security measures.

We also continuously try to:

- Improve the security of the Game’s code, networking, and backend systems.  
- Detect and mitigate cheating, hacking, or abusive behaviour.  
- Avoid unnecessary exposure of personal data in leaderboards, chat, or other social features.

However, no system is completely secure. While we work to make Orbis Mayhem as secure and stable as we reasonably can, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Your use of the Game is at your own risk, subject to applicable law and the Terms of Use.

---

## 12. Ownership of Code and Assets

Unless expressly stated otherwise (for example, in specific in-game credits, on the store page, or in a README/`LICENSE` file on GitHub):

- All original code, game logic, gameplay systems, art, design, and other creative elements of Orbis Mayhem are created and owned by the developers of Orbis Mayhem, acting under the name **Marins PlayLab Studio**.  
- Some assets used in the Game (for example, visual, audio, or code components) may come from third-party sources such as asset store marketplaces (e.g., Unity Asset Store) or other licensed providers. Those assets remain the property of their respective owners and are used under appropriate licenses or purchase agreements.

This ownership structure does not change your data protection rights, but it clarifies who owns the underlying Game components and how third-party assets are incorporated.

---

## 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect:

- Changes in the Game or our services (including accounts, leaderboards, chat, or new features).  
- Changes in third-party integrations (e.g., new SDKs or providers).  
- Changes in legal or regulatory requirements.

When we make changes, we will update the **Effective date** at the top of this document. Where required or appropriate, we will also provide in-game or app-store notices. Your continued use of the Game after the updated Policy is made available will constitute your acceptance of the changes, to the extent permitted by law.
